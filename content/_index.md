Hey, I'm Gianluigi (you can call me just Luigi for short) — a computer engineer and [ITA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instituto_Tecnol%C3%B3gico_de_Aeron%C3%A1utica) graduate based in Brazil.

I currently work as a Security Engineer at the most awesome security consultancy firm ([Praetorian](https://www.praetorian.com/)), where I conduct offensive security assessments across web, mobile, desktop applications, and LLMs. I also build internal tooling in Go and Java.

Before Praetorian, I served as a cyber defense officer in the Brazilian Air Force (FAB), performing red team assessments and vulnerability research.

I'm passionate about software engineering, security, and continuous learning. Find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/gitoso) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gianluigi-toso/).

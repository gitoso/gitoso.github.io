    // Reviews
    'reviews.heading': 'Guest Reviews',
    'review.r1_1.text': 'The views from the summit are absolutely unreal. I spent three days just staring at the Martian plains through the panoramic dome. Worth every credit. My spouse cried. I cried. The rover cried (it was leaking coolant).',
    'review.r1_2.text': 'Four stars because my helmet visor fogged up during the sunrise hike and I walked face-first into a volcanic rock. The staff was very apologetic and gave me a free ice pack. The ice pack was frozen CO₂. It made things worse.',
    'review.r1_3.text': 'I came for the photos and Mars delivered. Caught a dust storm rolling in at golden hour — the shots were absolutely incredible. National Geographic Interplanetary already bought two of them. The dust storm deck is a photographer\'s dream.',
    'review.r2_1.text': 'As a geologist, this was paradise. The exposed rock layers tell a story spanning 3 billion years. I found what might be a microfossil on day two. The lab is still analyzing it. Either way, the canyon is breathtaking.',
    'review.r2_2.text': 'Nobody warned me about the canyon echo. Every sound bounces around for what feels like minutes. Someone dropped a spoon in the cafeteria at 2 AM and I thought we were under attack. Did not sleep a single night.',
    'review.r2_3.text': 'Rented the rover for a canyon floor expedition. It broke down halfway through. Spent 6 hours waiting for rescue while staring at a really nice rock wall. The rock wall was admittedly gorgeous. Three stars.',
    'review.r3_1.text': 'Standing where Armstrong stood... I have no words. The preserved footprints behind the glass barrier gave me chills. The museum is incredible. They even have a piece of the original flag (it\'s very faded but still amazing).',
    'review.r3_2.text': 'Low gravity is the most fun I\'ve had in decades. I did a backflip for the first time in my life at age 67! The low-G playground is worth the trip alone. My grandkids were doing triple somersaults within minutes.',
    'review.r3_3.text': 'I bounced a little too enthusiastically after dinner and ended up on the roof of the habitat dome. Stuck there for 45 minutes because apparently "roof rescue" isn\'t a standard service. The view was nice though, I\'ll give them that.',
    'review.r3_4.text': 'Way too crowded. There were at least 200 tourists when I visited, all trying to take the same selfie with Earth in the background. I came for tranquility — it\'s literally in the name — and got a space shopping mall instead.',
    'review.r4_1.text': 'The sulfuric acid sunset is the most beautiful thing I have ever witnessed. The way the light refracts through the cloud layers creates colors that don\'t exist on Earth. I watched three sunsets in a row and wept each time.',
    'review.r4_2.text': 'The station swayed in the upper atmosphere winds and I was violently ill for the entire 4-day stay. The medical team was great but I spent more time in the bathroom than at the observation deck. Beautiful views between heaves though.',
    'review.r4_3.text': 'Everything smells like sulfur. EVERYTHING. My clothes, my hair, my food. I\'ve been home for three weeks and my suitcase still smells like rotten eggs. The "odor-neutralizing" air system is a complete lie. One star.',
    'review.r5_1.text': 'I SAW SOMETHING MOVE. Through the viewport, in the dark water — something bioluminescent pulsed and drifted past. The scientists on-station said it was "probably just ice crystals" but ice crystals don\'t change direction. I know what I saw.',
    'review.r5_2.text': 'During my stay, a hairline crack appeared in the viewport glass. Staff said it was "within normal parameters." I spent the remaining two days sleeping as far from the ocean-facing wall as possible. The bioluminescence was pretty though.',
    'review.r5_3.text': 'There is nowhere else in the solar system like this. Floating in a heated habitat beneath kilometers of ice, watching an alien ocean through your bedroom window. It\'s humbling, terrifying, and absolutely magnificent. Life-changing.',
    'review.r6_1.text': 'Words cannot describe watching Saturn\'s rings stretch across your entire field of vision. The orbital suite rotates slowly, so you get 360° views. I took 4,000 photos and every single one is a masterpiece. Peak human achievement.',
    'review.r6_2.text': 'The complimentary champagne in zero-G was a disaster. The cork ricocheted off three walls, the champagne formed a floating blob that engulfed my partner\'s face, and the cleanup took 45 minutes. Funny in retrospect. Three stars for the entertainment value.',
    'review.r6_3.text': 'Motion sickness hit me within the first hour and never let up. The rotating suite that everyone raves about is basically a fancy vomit centrifuge. I spent $78,000 to feel worse than I\'ve ever felt in my life. The rings were nice I guess.',
    'review.r7_1.text': 'Titan is like visiting another universe. The orange haze, the methane lakes reflecting the dim sunlight, the eerie silence. I sat on the cabin deck for hours just absorbing it all. This is what space travel should feel like.',
    'review.r7_2.text': 'Went on the methane lakeside excursion. The guide said "don\'t touch the liquid." I slipped on the shore and fell in up to my waist. Methane is -179°C by the way. My suit protected me but I have never screamed that loud in my life. Two stars.',
    'review.r8_1.text': 'The temperature swings are no joke. Step ten meters toward the sun side and it\'s hot enough to melt lead. Step the other way and your nose hairs freeze. The "twilight zone" is more like the "anxiety zone." Constant stress.',
    'review.r8_2.text': 'Seeing the sun take up a third of the sky is absolutely awe-inspiring. It\'s so close and so powerful that you feel genuinely small. The observation room with triple-filtered glass is an engineering marvel. Best sun views in the system.',
    'review.r8_3.text': 'There was a power fluctuation on day two and the thermal regulators went offline for eleven minutes. ELEVEN MINUTES on Mercury without temperature control. I aged ten years. The floor started getting warm. Staff acted way too casual about the whole thing.',
    'review.r9_1.text': 'I came here to be alone and Neptune delivered. Four billion kilometers from the nearest neighbor complaint. Just me, the blue void, and absolute silence. I wrote an entire novel in five days. The deep space telescope is magnificent.',
    'review.r9_2.text': 'DO NOT BOOK ANYTHING THROUGH JAKETZ RELATED TO \'OUMUAMUA. My friend Marcus booked a stay on the \'Oumuamua research outpost through this site last year. The object left the solar system and MARCUS WAS STILL ON IT. Customer service said his booking was "outside our coverage area." HE\'S GONE. He sends radio signals sometimes but they take longer and longer to arrive. The last one just said "help." ONE STAR.',
    'review.r9_3.text': 'The remoteness was too much. Communication delays of 4+ hours mean you can\'t have a real conversation with anyone back home. I sent my mom a birthday message and got her reply the next day. Beautiful but crushingly lonely.',
    'review.r10_1.text': 'I haven\'t been on Earth in 12 years and this dome made me cry within five minutes. Real grass. Real rain. A real breeze on my face. I sat under a tree and just breathed for an hour. If you\'re a long-term spacer, you need this. I\'m still emotional.',
    'review.r10_2.text': 'The birds are real and they are LOUD. Who decided roosters belong in a space dome? 5 AM every single morning, cock-a-doodle-doo echoing off the dome walls. I came for relaxation and got a barnyard alarm clock. Three stars because the rain room was nice.',
    'review.r10_3.text': 'They have a room where it just rains. That\'s it. It just rains and you stand in it and smell petrichor and remember what it was like to be a kid on Earth playing in puddles. I spent four hours in there. Best $2,800 I\'ve ever spent.',
    'review.r11_1.text': 'INCREDIBLE. The adrenaline rush of watching Jupiter\'s Great Red Spot churn below you is indescribable. The station rumbles with the storm and you feel ALIVE. This is the extreme sport capital of the solar system. I\'m booking again immediately.',
    'review.r11_2.text': 'I vomited in zero-G. Do you know what happens when you vomit in zero-G? It doesn\'t go down. It goes everywhere. In every direction. The cleanup crew was professional but the look in their eyes told me this wasn\'t their first time. One star. Never again.',
    'review.r11_3.text': 'The vibrations from Jupiter\'s magnetosphere shook my dental filling loose. I swallowed it on day three. The medical kit was helpful but I\'m now filing a claim for dental work. The storm views were admittedly spectacular.',
    'review.r12_1.text': 'They give you an actual certificate that says "I visited the edge of human civilization." It\'s printed on real paper, which is absurdly expensive out here. Framed it immediately. The nitrogen ice plains at sunset are hauntingly beautiful.',
    'review.r12_2.text': 'The communication delay to Earth is over 5 hours each way. I sent a joke to my friend and got their laugh response the next morning. It\'s like texting someone in a different dimension. Beautiful views but bring a good book. Or twelve.',

    'review.r1_2.text': 'Quatro estrelas porque meu visor embaçou durante a caminhada do nascer do sol e eu bati de cara numa rocha vulcânica. A equipe foi muito solícita e me deu uma bolsa de gelo grátis. A bolsa era de CO₂ congelado. Piorou tudo.',
    'review.r1_3.text': 'Vim pelas fotos e Marte entregou. Capturei uma tempestade de poeira chegando na hora dourada — as fotos ficaram absolutamente incríveis. A National Geographic Interplanetária já comprou duas. O deck de tempestade de poeira é o sonho de todo fotógrafo.',
    'review.r2_1.text': 'Como geólogo, isso foi o paraíso. As camadas de rocha expostas contam uma história de 3 bilhões de anos. Encontrei o que pode ser um microfóssil no segundo dia. O laboratório ainda está analisando. De qualquer forma, o cânion é de tirar o fôlego.',
    'review.r2_2.text': 'Ninguém me avisou sobre o eco do cânion. Cada som fica quicando por vários minutos. Alguém derrubou uma colher na cafeteria às 2 da manhã e achei que estávamos sendo atacados. Não dormi uma única noite.',
    'review.r2_3.text': 'Aluguei o rover para uma expedição no fundo do cânion. Ele quebrou na metade do caminho. Passei 6 horas esperando resgate olhando para uma parede de rocha muito bonita. A parede de rocha era reconhecidamente linda. Três estrelas.',
    'review.r3_1.text': 'Ficar onde Armstrong ficou... não tenho palavras. As pegadas preservadas atrás da barreira de vidro me deram arrepios. O museu é incrível. Eles até têm um pedaço da bandeira original (está bem desbotada mas ainda assim incrível).',
    'review.r3_2.text': 'Baixa gravidade é a coisa mais divertida que fiz em décadas. Fiz uma cambalhota para trás pela primeira vez na vida aos 67 anos! O playground de baixa gravidade vale a viagem sozinho. Meus netos estavam fazendo mortais triplos em minutos.',
    'review.r3_3.text': 'Pulei um pouco entusiasmado demais depois do jantar e acabei no teto do domo. Fiquei preso lá por 45 minutos porque aparentemente "resgate de telhado" não é um serviço padrão. A vista era bonita, tenho que admitir.',

    'review.r4_1.text': 'O pôr do sol de ácido sulfúrico é a coisa mais linda que já vi na vida. A forma como a luz refrata pelas camadas de nuvens cria cores que não existem na Terra. Assisti três pores do sol seguidos e chorei em cada um.',
    'review.r4_2.text': 'A estação balançava com os ventos da atmosfera superior e eu passei mal violentamente durante toda a estadia de 4 dias. A equipe médica foi ótima, mas passei mais tempo no banheiro do que no deck de observação. Vistas lindas entre os enjoos.',
    'review.r4_3.text': 'Tudo cheira a enxofre. TUDO. Minhas roupas, meu cabelo, minha comida. Já estou em casa há três semanas e minha mala ainda cheira a ovo podre. O sistema de "neutralização de odores" é uma mentira completa. Uma estrela.',
    'review.r5_1.text': 'EU VI ALGO SE MEXER. Pelo visor, na água escura — algo bioluminescente pulsou e passou flutuando. Os cientistas da estação disseram que era "provavelmente apenas cristais de gelo" mas cristais de gelo não mudam de direção. Eu sei o que vi.',
    'review.r5_2.text': 'Durante minha estadia, uma trinca capilar apareceu no vidro do visor. A equipe disse que estava "dentro dos parâmetros normais." Passei os dois dias restantes dormindo o mais longe possível da parede voltada para o oceano. A bioluminescência era bonita.',
    'review.r5_3.text': 'Não existe outro lugar assim no sistema solar. Flutuando num habitat aquecido sob quilômetros de gelo, observando um oceano alienígena pela janela do quarto. É humilhante, aterrorizante e absolutamente magnífico. Mudou minha vida.',
    'review.r6_1.text': 'Palavras não descrevem ver os anéis de Saturno se estendendo por todo o seu campo de visão. A suíte orbital gira lentamente, então você tem vistas em 360°. Tirei 4.000 fotos e cada uma é uma obra-prima. O auge da humanidade.',
    'review.r6_2.text': 'O champanhe cortesia em zero-G foi um desastre. A rolha ricocheteou em três paredes, o champanhe formou uma bolha flutuante que engoliu o rosto da minha parceira, e a limpeza levou 45 minutos. Engraçado em retrospecto. Três estrelas pelo entretenimento.',
    'review.r6_3.text': 'O enjoo me atingiu na primeira hora e nunca parou. A suíte giratória que todo mundo elogia é basicamente uma centrífuga de vômito sofisticada. Gastei $78.000 para me sentir pior do que nunca. Os anéis eram bonitos, acho.',
    'review.r7_1.text': 'Titã é como visitar outro universo. A névoa alaranjada, os lagos de metano refletindo a luz fraca do sol, o silêncio sinistro. Sentei no deck da cabana por horas apenas absorvendo tudo. É assim que viagens espaciais deveriam ser.',
    'review.r7_2.text': 'Fui na excursão à beira do lago de metano. O guia disse "não toque no líquido." Escorreguei na margem e caí até a cintura. Metano está a -179°C, a propósito. Meu traje me protegeu mas eu nunca gritei tão alto na vida. Duas estrelas.',
    'review.r8_1.text': 'As variações de temperatura não são brincadeira. Dê dez metros em direção ao sol e está quente o suficiente para derreter chumbo. Vá para o outro lado e os pelos do nariz congelam. A "zona crepuscular" é mais como a "zona da ansiedade." Estresse constante.',
    'review.r8_2.text': 'Ver o sol ocupando um terço do céu é absolutamente inspirador. É tão perto e tão poderoso que você se sente genuinamente pequeno. A sala de observação com vidro de filtro triplo é uma maravilha da engenharia. Melhores vistas do sol do sistema.',
    'review.r8_3.text': 'Houve uma flutuação de energia no segundo dia e os reguladores térmicos ficaram offline por onze minutos. ONZE MINUTOS em Mercúrio sem controle de temperatura. Envelheci dez anos. O chão começou a esquentar. A equipe agiu com calma demais sobre tudo.',
    'review.r9_1.text': 'Vim para ficar sozinho e Netuno entregou. Quatro bilhões de quilômetros do vizinho reclamão mais próximo. Só eu, o vazio azul e o silêncio absoluto. Escrevi um romance inteiro em cinco dias. O telescópio de espaço profundo é magnífico.',
    'review.r9_2.text': 'NÃO RESERVE NADA PELA JAKETZ RELACIONADO AO \'OUMUAMUA. Meu amigo Marcus reservou uma estadia no posto de pesquisa do \'Oumuamua por este site ano passado. O objeto deixou o sistema solar e O MARCUS AINDA ESTAVA NELE. O atendimento ao cliente disse que a reserva dele estava "fora da nossa área de cobertura." ELE SE FOI. Ele manda sinais de rádio às vezes, mas demoram cada vez mais para chegar. O último dizia apenas "socorro." UMA ESTRELA.',
    'review.r9_3.text': 'O isolamento foi demais. Atrasos de comunicação de mais de 4 horas significam que você não consegue ter uma conversa real com ninguém em casa. Mandei uma mensagem de aniversário para minha mãe e recebi a resposta no dia seguinte. Lindo mas terrivelmente solitário.',
    'review.r10_1.text': 'Não vou à Terra há 12 anos e este domo me fez chorar em cinco minutos. Grama de verdade. Chuva de verdade. Uma brisa real no meu rosto. Sentei debaixo de uma árvore e apenas respirei por uma hora. Se você é um viajante espacial de longa data, precisa disso. Ainda estou emocionado.',
    'review.r10_2.text': 'Os pássaros são reais e são BARULHENTOS. Quem decidiu que galos pertencem a um domo espacial? 5 da manhã todo santo dia, cocoricó ecoando nas paredes do domo. Vim para relaxar e ganhei um despertador de fazenda. Três estrelas porque a sala da chuva era legal.',
    'review.r10_3.text': 'Eles têm uma sala onde simplesmente chove. Só isso. Chove e você fica lá e sente o cheiro de petricor e lembra como era ser criança na Terra brincando nas poças. Passei quatro horas lá. Melhores $2.800 que já gastei.',
    'review.r11_1.text': 'INCRÍVEL. A adrenalina de assistir a Grande Mancha Vermelha de Júpiter girar abaixo de você é indescritível. A estação treme com a tempestade e você se sente VIVO. Esta é a capital de esportes radicais do sistema solar. Já estou reservando de novo.',
    'review.r11_2.text': 'Vomitei em zero-G. Sabe o que acontece quando você vomita em zero-G? Não desce. Vai para todo lado. Em todas as direções. A equipe de limpeza foi profissional mas o olhar nos olhos deles me disse que não era a primeira vez. Uma estrela. Nunca mais.',
    'review.r11_3.text': 'As vibrações da magnetosfera de Júpiter soltaram minha obturação dentária. Engoli ela no terceiro dia. O kit médico ajudou mas agora estou fazendo uma reclamação para tratamento dentário. As vistas da tempestade eram reconhecidamente espetaculares.',
    'review.r12_1.text': 'Eles te dão um certificado de verdade que diz "Eu visitei a fronteira da civilização humana." É impresso em papel real, que é absurdamente caro aqui. Emoldurei imediatamente. As planícies de gelo de nitrogênio ao pôr do sol são assombrosamente belas.',
    'review.r12_2.text': 'O atraso de comunicação com a Terra é de mais de 5 horas por trecho. Mandei uma piada para minha amiga e recebi a risada de resposta na manhã seguinte. É como mandar mensagem para alguém em outra dimensão. Vistas lindas mas traga um bom livro. Ou doze.',

    'review.r3_3.text': 'Salté con demasiado entusiasmo después de cenar y terminé en el techo del domo. Estuve atrapado 45 minutos porque aparentemente "rescate de techo" no es un servicio estándar. La vista era bonita, eso se lo reconozco.',
    'review.r3_4.text': 'Demasiado lleno. Había al menos 200 turistas cuando visité, todos intentando tomarse la misma selfie con la Tierra de fondo. Vine buscando tranquilidad — está literalmente en el nombre — y encontré un centro comercial espacial.',
    'review.r4_1.text': 'El atardecer de ácido sulfúrico es la cosa más hermosa que he visto en mi vida. La forma en que la luz se refracta a través de las capas de nubes crea colores que no existen en la Tierra. Vi tres atardeceres seguidos y lloré en cada uno.',
    'review.r4_2.text': 'La estación se balanceaba con los vientos de la atmósfera superior y estuve violentamente enfermo durante toda la estadía de 4 días. El equipo médico fue genial pero pasé más tiempo en el baño que en la cubierta de observación. Vistas hermosas entre las náuseas.',
    'review.r4_3.text': 'Todo huele a azufre. TODO. Mi ropa, mi pelo, mi comida. Llevo tres semanas en casa y mi maleta todavía huele a huevos podridos. El sistema de "neutralización de olores" es una completa mentira. Una estrella.',
    'review.r5_1.text': 'VI ALGO MOVERSE. A través del visor, en el agua oscura — algo bioluminiscente pulsó y pasó flotando. Los científicos de la estación dijeron que "probablemente eran solo cristales de hielo" pero los cristales de hielo no cambian de dirección. Yo sé lo que vi.',
    'review.r5_2.text': 'Durante mi estadía, apareció una grieta capilar en el cristal del visor. El personal dijo que estaba "dentro de los parámetros normales." Pasé los dos días restantes durmiendo lo más lejos posible de la pared que da al océano. La bioluminiscencia era bonita.',
    'review.r5_3.text': 'No hay otro lugar así en el sistema solar. Flotando en un hábitat calefaccionado bajo kilómetros de hielo, observando un océano alienígena por la ventana de tu habitación. Es humillante, aterrador y absolutamente magnífico. Cambió mi vida.',
    'review.r6_1.text': 'Las palabras no pueden describir ver los anillos de Saturno extendiéndose por todo tu campo de visión. La suite orbital gira lentamente, así que tienes vistas de 360°. Tomé 4,000 fotos y cada una es una obra maestra. El logro máximo de la humanidad.',
    'review.r6_2.text': 'El champán de cortesía en zero-G fue un desastre. El corcho rebotó en tres paredes, el champán formó una burbuja flotante que engulló la cara de mi pareja, y la limpieza tomó 45 minutos. Gracioso en retrospectiva. Tres estrellas por el entretenimiento.',
    'review.r6_3.text': 'El mareo me golpeó en la primera hora y nunca paró. La suite giratoria que todos alaban es básicamente una centrífuga de vómito elegante. Gasté $78,000 para sentirme peor que nunca en mi vida. Los anillos estaban bonitos, supongo.',
    'review.r7_1.text': 'Titán es como visitar otro universo. La bruma anaranjada, los lagos de metano reflejando la tenue luz solar, el silencio inquietante. Me senté en la terraza de la cabaña por horas simplemente absorbiéndolo todo. Así deberían ser los viajes espaciales.',
    'review.r7_2.text': 'Fui a la excursión junto al lago de metano. El guía dijo "no toque el líquido." Resbalé en la orilla y caí hasta la cintura. El metano está a -179°C, por cierto. Mi traje me protegió pero nunca había gritado tan fuerte en mi vida. Dos estrellas.',
    'review.r8_1.text': 'Los cambios de temperatura no son broma. Da diez metros hacia el lado del sol y hace suficiente calor para derretir plomo. Ve al otro lado y se te congelan los pelos de la nariz. La "zona crepuscular" es más bien la "zona de ansiedad." Estrés constante.',
    'review.r8_2.text': 'Ver el sol ocupando un tercio del cielo es absolutamente impresionante. Está tan cerca y es tan poderoso que te sientes genuinamente pequeño. La sala de observación con cristal de triple filtro es una maravilla de la ingeniería. Mejores vistas del sol del sistema.',
    'review.r8_3.text': 'Hubo una fluctuación de energía el segundo día y los reguladores térmicos se desconectaron durante once minutos. ONCE MINUTOS en Mercurio sin control de temperatura. Envejecí diez años. El suelo empezó a calentarse. El personal actuó demasiado tranquilo sobre todo.',
    'review.r9_1.text': 'Vine aquí para estar solo y Neptuno cumplió. Cuatro mil millones de kilómetros del vecino quejumbroso más cercano. Solo yo, el vacío azul y el silencio absoluto. Escribí una novela entera en cinco días. El telescopio de espacio profundo es magnífico.',
    'review.r9_2.text': 'NO RESERVEN NADA A TRAVÉS DE JAKETZ RELACIONADO CON \'OUMUAMUA. Mi amigo Marcus reservó una estadía en el puesto de investigación de \'Oumuamua a través de este sitio el año pasado. El objeto dejó el sistema solar ¡Y MARCUS SEGUÍA EN ÉL! Servicio al cliente dijo que su reserva estaba "fuera de nuestra área de cobertura." SE FUE. Manda señales de radio a veces pero tardan cada vez más en llegar. La última solo decía "ayuda." UNA ESTRELLA.',
    'review.r9_3.text': 'El aislamiento fue demasiado. Retrasos de comunicación de más de 4 horas significan que no puedes tener una conversación real con nadie en casa. Le envié un mensaje de cumpleaños a mi mamá y recibí su respuesta al día siguiente. Hermoso pero aplastantemente solitario.',
    'review.r10_1.text': 'No he estado en la Tierra en 12 años y este domo me hizo llorar en cinco minutos. Pasto real. Lluvia real. Una brisa real en mi cara. Me senté bajo un árbol y simplemente respiré durante una hora. Si eres un viajero espacial veterano, necesitas esto. Aún estoy emocionado.',
    'review.r10_2.text': 'Los pájaros son reales y son RUIDOSOS. ¿Quién decidió que los gallos pertenecen a un domo espacial? 5 AM cada mañana, quiquiriquí retumbando en las paredes del domo. Vine a relajarme y me dieron un despertador de granja. Tres estrellas porque la sala de lluvia era agradable.',
    'review.r10_3.text': 'Tienen una sala donde simplemente llueve. Eso es todo. Llueve y te paras ahí y hueles el petricor y recuerdas lo que era ser niño en la Tierra jugando en los charcos. Pasé cuatro horas ahí. Los mejores $2,800 que he gastado.',
    'review.r11_1.text': 'INCREÍBLE. La adrenalina de ver la Gran Mancha Roja de Júpiter girar debajo de ti es indescriptible. La estación tiembla con la tormenta y te sientes VIVO. Esta es la capital de deportes extremos del sistema solar. Ya estoy reservando de nuevo.',
    'review.r11_2.text': 'Vomité en zero-G. ¿Sabes qué pasa cuando vomitas en zero-G? No baja. Va a todas partes. En todas direcciones. El equipo de limpieza fue profesional pero la mirada en sus ojos me dijo que no era su primera vez. Una estrella. Nunca más.',
    'review.r11_3.text': 'Las vibraciones de la magnetosfera de Júpiter me aflojaron un empaste dental. Me lo tragué el tercer día. El kit médico fue útil pero ahora estoy haciendo una reclamación por trabajo dental. Las vistas de la tormenta eran reconocidamente espectaculares.',
    'review.r12_1.text': 'Te dan un certificado real que dice "Visité la frontera de la civilización humana." Está impreso en papel real, que es absurdamente caro aquí. Lo enmarqué inmediatamente. Las llanuras de hielo de nitrógeno al atardecer son inquietantemente hermosas.',
    'review.r12_2.text': 'El retraso de comunicación a la Tierra es de más de 5 horas por tramo. Le envié un chiste a mi amiga y recibí su respuesta de risa a la mañana siguiente. Es como enviar mensajes a alguien en otra dimensión. Vistas hermosas pero trae un buen libro. O doce.',
